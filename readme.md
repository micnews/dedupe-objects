# dedupe-objects [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/micnews/dedupe-objects.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/micnews/dedupe-objects)

Given two objects, reuse common objects between the both objects

## Installation

Download node at [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org) and install it, if you haven't already.

```sh
npm install dedupe-objects --save
```

## Usage

```js
import dedupe from 'dedupe-objects';

const from = { beep: { boop: true }, foo: { bar: false } };
const to = { beep: { hello: 'world' }, foo: { bar: false } };
const result = dedupe(from, to);

// will be true since from.foo is deep equal to to.foo
console.log(from.foo === result.foo);
// will be an object { hello: 'world' }
console.log(result.beep);

```

## Tests

```sh
npm install
npm test
```
